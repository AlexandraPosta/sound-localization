# Sound Source Localization
Welcome to the git repository for my third-year dissertation. This repository contains all of the code, data, and documentation associated with my research. 


# Summary
The aim of this tool is to allow for a simpler comparison between mathematical and machine learning models of identifying the location of a sound. 


## Features
In order to run a simulation, you can:
- select environment
- select type and number of microphones used
- select sound source
- select prediction model
- analyse based on the statistics provided
